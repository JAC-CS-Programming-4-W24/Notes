# Sets

> The defining feature of sets is that its elements are UNIQUE.

In mathematics, a set is defined as **a collection of distinct, well-defined objects forming a group**. There can be any number of items, be it a collection of whole numbers, months of a year, types of birds, and so on. Each item in the set is known as an element of the set.

In other words a *set* is a collection of **distinct** elements.

```text
{2, 3, 5, 7} 
{'a', 'b', 'c'} 
{"aardvark", "aardwolf", "albatross"}
```

## Sets in Computer Science

In computer program, sets are represented by a collection of elements.   For each `element`, there must be some identifying feature that distinguishes one `element` from another, which ensures that each element in the set is *unique*.

In this discussion, the elements in our sets will be `objects` that have a property `id` which is unique to each object.

### Operations

#### Contains

The fundamental operation *contains* (a.k.a.: member, usually denoted by $\in$) on a set is to tell
if an element is contained within it:

$$
a \in {a, b, c}
c \not\in {a, b}
$$

#### Contains all

Determine if every element of a set $A$ is also in a second set $B$, that is, $A$ is entirely in $B$
(a.k.a. subset). This is usually written as $A \subseteq B$. For example:

$$
\{a, c\} \subseteq \{a, b, c, d\}  \hspace{1cm}  \{b, d\} \not\subseteq \{a, b, c\}
$$

A more formal definition of subset is: 

â€‹	for all $x$, if $x \in A$ then $x \in B$.

#### Add

Sets are built using an operation for adding an element to an existing set. If we have a set
$\{a,b\}$, then $\textbf{add}(c)$ would yield $\{a,b,c\}$. Add should behave like the traditional
set *union* operation $\cup$, in that adding a duplicate to a set would leave the set unchanged. Ex:

$$
\{a,b,c\} \cup \{d\}  = \{a,b,c,d\} \hspace{1cm} \{a,b,c\} \cup \{b\} = \{a,b,c\}
$$

#### Remove

An element can be removed from a sorted set using the remove operation. If we have a set
$\{a,b,c\}$, then $\textbf{remove}(c)$ would yield $\{a, b\}$. Remove should behave like the
traditional set *difference* operation $-$, in that removing an element not in the original set
results in the set unchanged. Ex:

$$
\{ a, b, c \} - \{ d \} = \{ a, b, c \} \hspace{1cm} \{ a, b, c \} - \{ b \} = \{ a, c \}
$$

#### Size

Number of elements of the set (a.k.a. cardinality). This is usually written as $|A|$.

$$
A= \{ a, b, c \} \hspace{1cm} |A| = 3
$$

#### Empty

Determine if the set is empty ($\{\}$) or full.
